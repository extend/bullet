Bullet Chat
============

To compile this example you need rebar in your PATH.

Type the following command:
```
$ rebar get-deps compile
```

You can then start the Erlang node with the following command:
```
./start.sh
```

Then point your browser to the indicated URL.

You can interrupt temporarily the node to check that Bullet
properly reconnects when something happens.
